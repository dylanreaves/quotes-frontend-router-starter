    TODO: define your routes below.

    Part 1 — Home renders at the root path "/". This is an
      "index" route: it renders at the parent's own path
      instead of a sub-path.

    Part 3 — QuoteDetail renders at a dynamic path that captures
      an id from the URL (a "path parameter").

    Part 4 — AddQuote renders at a fixed path.

    Part 5 — NotFound catches anything that didn't match any
      route above. It must come LAST, or it swallows every
      route below it.
